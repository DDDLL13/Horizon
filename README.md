## What's Horizon?
Horizon is a large-scale CS2 CFG project aimed at integrating and supporting all CS2 CFG functionalities while offering powerful customization options. Horizon is primarily designed for competitivee rules, meaning it operates under `sv_cheats 0`. However, it also includes some features that can be used in personal practicees.

The ultimate goal of Horizon is to become the only CFG you'll ever need for CS2. 

In most cases, using Horizon will not result in a VAC ban. It is simply a CFG project.
