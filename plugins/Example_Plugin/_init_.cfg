//here is a example plugins to show how to change the Horizon
//For plugins we need register file.named your plugins then create a <your plugin name>.cfg
//and then create a folder named <your plugin name>
//create _init_.cfg in <your plugin name> folder
//here you can register your behavior commands
//then Create Userspace.cfg 
//if your plugin can be change by user.
//now i'll show you how to create a plugin for fast enable/disable crosshair recoil

//Now we define crosshair color at first
//Please open Userspace

//then we register 2 command to enable or disable crosshair
//'cause horizon managed crosshair so we need use horizon api to change
//so we use hzcrosshair_recoil_enable/disable
//it's seem like 
//alias corsshair_g_on "hzcrosshair_recoil_enable;cl_crosshair_recoil true"
//alias corsshair_g_off "hzcrosshair_recoil_disable; cl_crosshair_recoil false"
//but now we need add colorful module on it so it's seem like
alias corsshair_g_on "recoil_r;recoil_g;recoil_b;hzcrosshair_recoil_enable;cl_crosshair_recoil true"
alias corsshair_g_off "recoil__r;recoil__g;recoil__b;hzcrosshair_recoil_enable;cl_crosshair_recoil true"

//Now we need register a keybind behavior
//do you know alias list?we can think a problem at first
//a farmer has 2 sheeps and 1 wolf,sheeps'll eaten by wolf,now farmer wanna take sheeps and wolf cross a river
//but the farmer only has a boat that can carry two people or mobs
//to solve this problem, we need to introduce a third factor: why can't a ship be able to carry people back, if it can carry people over
//So we can use this idea to solve the CFG problem
//so we can do this:
alias corsshair "corsshair1";
alias corsshair1 "corsshair_g_on; alias corsshair corsshair2"
alias corsshair2 "corsshair_g_off; alias corsshair corsshair1"
